# shapes

A basic android test app designesd to find the area and circumfearence of different shapes such as circle, square, rectangle and many more.

This is very intutive and user friendly android application as i created the ui of the app using the android studio.
I worked my way into it by adding the logic for calculating the area and circumference in the logic.java file that i have uploaded here.


This is a test app that i was practicing to check the font size and allignment of the text wraps that i was using.
The idea was taken from the coursera 

The basic appearence of the app no home screen added.
