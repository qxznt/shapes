# shapes

An intutive and user friendly android application to find the area and circumfearence of different shapes such as circle, square, rectangle, trianlge  and more.

The persona and the ui of the app is build and shaped using the android studio.
I worked my way into it by adding the logic for calculating the area and circumference in the file that i have uploaded here.


This is a test app to check the font size, allignment of the text wraps and the drop box that i have used.
The idea is from the coursera.

The basic appearence of the app (no home screen added).

The output if we wish to calculate the area and perimeter of any shpae.

Drop box to save time and to make it more accessible.
